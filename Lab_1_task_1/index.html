<strong>Fairy</strong>
<em>Over hill, over dale,
<br>Thorough bush, thorough brier,
<br>Over park, over pale,
<br>Thorough flood, thorough fire,
<br>I do wander everywhere,
<br>Swifter than the moon's sphere;
<br>And I serve the fairy queen,
<br>To dew her orbs upon the green.
<br>The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
<br>In their gold coats spots you see;
<br>Those be rubies, fairy favours,
<br>In those freckles live their savours:
<br>I must go seek some dewdrops here
<br>And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
<br>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
<br>Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>PUCK</strong>
<em>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
<br>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
<br>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
<br>Because that she as her attendant hath
<br>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
<br>She never had so sweet a changeling;
<br>And jealous Oberon would have the child
<br>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
<br>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
<br>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
<br>And now they never meet in grove or green,
<br>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
<br>But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
<br>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</em>
